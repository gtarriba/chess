# Analysis of chess games
In this repository you will find my analysis of the determinants of the outcomes of chess games. I use a dataset with over 20,000 chess games played on lichess.com.
[The dataset is available on Kaggle ](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/chess). Credit to Kaggle user [Mitchell J](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek)
